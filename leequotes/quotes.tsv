famous	Absorbe ce qui est utile, rejette ce qui ne l'est pas et ajoute ce qui t'est propre
famous	Empty your mind. \nBe formless, shapeless, like water. \nYou put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. \nYou put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. \nYou put it into a teapot, it becomes the teapot. \nNow water can flow or it can crash. \nBe water, my friend.
famous	When the student is ready, the master will appear
life	In order to taste my cup of water you must first empty your cup. My friend, drop all of your preconceived fixed ideas and be neutral. Do you know why this cup is so useful? Because it is empty
life	Life is never stagnation. It is a constant movement, unrhythmic movement, as well as constant change. Things live by moving and gain strength as they go.
life	Be pliable. When a man is living, he is soft and pliable; when he is dead, he becomes rigid. Pliability is life; rigidity is death, whether one speaks of man’s body, his mind, or his spirit.
life	Life itself is your teacher, and you are in a state of constant learning.
life	To live is to express, and to express you have to create. Creation is never merely repetition. To live is to express oneself freely in creation.
life	Remember my friend to enjoy your planning as well as your accomplishment, for life is too short for negative energy.
time	The “moment” has no yesterday or tomorrow. It is not the result of thought and therefore has no time.
time	To spend time is to pass it in a specified manner. To waste time is to expend it thoughtlessly or carelessly. We all have time to either spend or waste, and it is our decision what to do with it. But once passed, it is gone forever.
time	Time means a lot to me because, you see, I, too, am also a learner and am often lost in the joy of forever developing and simplifying. If you love life, don’t waste time, for time is what life is made up of.
root	Concentration is the ROOT of all the higher abilities in man.
root	It is futile to argue as to which single leaf, which design of branch, or which attractive flower you like; when you understand the root, you understand all its blossoming.
root	What we are after is the ROOT and not the branches. The root is the real knowledge; the branches are surface knowledge. Real knowledge breeds “body feel” and personal expression; surface knowledge breeds mechanical conditioning and imposing limitation and squelches creativity.
root	The root is the fulcrum on which will rest the expression of your soul; the root is the “starting point” of all natural manifestation. If the root is right so will be all its manifestation. It cannot be, when the root is neglected, that what should spring from it will be well-ordered.
now	The past is no more, the future is not yet. NOW includes the balance of being here, experiencing, involvement, phenomenon, awareness.
now	We are always in a process of becoming and NOTHING is fixed. Have no rigid system in you, and you’ll be flexible to change with the ever changing. OPEN yourself and flow, my friend. Flow in the TOTAL OPENESS OF THE LIVING MOMENT. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. Moving, be like water. Still, be like a mirror. Respond like an echo.
now	You can never invite the wind, but you must leave the window open.
now	When you are in the NOW, you can’t be anxious, because the excitement flows immediately into ongoing spontaneous activity.
now	The Now and its synonyms. — One and the same thing: \nLiving in the NOW \nMaturity \nAuthenticity \nResponsibility for one’s action/life \nResponse — Ability \nHaving the Creativeness of the NOW available
now	To understand and live now, there must be dying to everything of yesterday. Die continually to every newly gained experience—be in a state of choiceless awareness of WHAT IS.
reality	What IS is more important than WHAT SHOULD BE. Too many people are looking at “what is” from a position of thinking “what should be.”
reality	At this moment stop inwardly — when you do stop inwardly, psychologically, your mind becomes very peaceful, very clear. Then you can really look at “this.”
reality	There is “what is” only when there is no comparison at all, and to live with what is, is to be peaceful.
law	A self-willed man obeys a different law, the one law I, too, hold absolutely sacred — the human law in himself, his own individual will.
law	The law of harmony, in which one should be in harmony with, and not in opposition to, the strength and force of the opposition. This means that one should do nothing that is not natural or spontaneous; the important thing is not to strain in any way.
death	I don’t know what is the meaning of death, but I am not afraid to die — and I go on, non-stop, going forward [with life]. Even though I, Bruce Lee, may die some day without fulfilling all of my ambitions, I will have no regrets. I did what I wanted to do and what I’ve done, I’ve done with sincerity and to the best of my ability. You can’t expect much more from life.
death	The round of summer and winter becomes a blessing the moment we give up the fantasy of eternal spring.
death	Like everyone else, you want to learn the way to win. But never to accept the way to lose. To accept defeat — to learn to die — is be liberated from it. Once you accept, you are free to flow and to harmonize. Fluidity is the way to an empty mind. You must free your ambitious mind and learn the art of dying.
death	Here now, forever more our lives must part. My path leads there and yours another way; I know not where tomorrow’s path may lead, nor what the future holds.
death	Remembrance is the only paradise out of which we cannot be driven away. Pleasure is the flower that fades, remembrance is the lasting perfume. Remembrances last longer than present realities; I have preserved blossoms for many years, but never fruits.
